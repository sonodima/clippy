> Cross-platform clipboard synchronization tool written in Java.

Clippy allows you to synchronize your clipboard across multiple devices in the same network.

This project is an old proof-of-concept that I wrote in 2019, hence the code quality and the user-friendliness are not the best.

I'm not planning to maintain this project, but feel free to fork it and improve it.

## Supported Platforms:

- Windows
- macOS

Linux support could be easily added by implementing a way to write data to the clipboard.

## Features:

- Synchronize clipboard between multiple devices in the same network
- Transfer files between devices (allows multiple files to be transferred at once)

## Requirements:

The project has been ported to Java 18, so you need to have it installed on your system.
